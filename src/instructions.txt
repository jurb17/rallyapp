Here are some rules followed in the construction of the app.

Forms use the Material UI (MUI) library and are structured with the <Grid> layout. This provides an easy way for us to standardize or customize the spacing between inputs on a form. There are multi-step forms and single page forms. The multi-stage form is most commonly used when 2 things are true: 1. The list of form inputs expands the display far beyond the vertical dimensions of the user's screen. 2. The form data is variable. Some of the single page forms are hard-coded because the data is non-variable. Each individual form input uses the "outlined" style provided by MUI. Each individual form input should have their validation scheme passed from the backend, including the validation type (what is being evaluated), the validation criteria (how to evaluate the input), and the validation response (how to respond when the input does not meet the criteria).

Buttons use the MUI library. Each button is contained within a <Box> component. The custom Button .js files are separated by the style qualities that they inherit because the style of the button implies its purpose within the display (red is commonly associated with the delete action). This strategy gives the development team the same insight into the styling of the button when coding without having to read the list of styke attributes. Instead, the style is inherent within the name of the component (DeleteButton.js, for example).
